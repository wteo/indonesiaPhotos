# Photo Gallery

I built this landing page whilst learning the more advanced concepts of CSS such as FlexBox, Media Response, Grid, Transitions, and Animations. This single page website features many of my favourite travel photoes whilst I was touring around Indonesia in 2018.

<h2>The use of CSS</h2>

<h4>The Grid Box</h4>

By default, the photo galleries are arranged in a 2 columns x n rows Grid.

When you shrink the page to the width of 779px or smaller, the Grid arrangement becomes 1 column x n rows.
